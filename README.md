## 🛠️ Customization Guide

### Adding New Conversation Topics

1. **Open `index.html` in any text editor**

3. **Add your new intent**:

```javascript
{
    "tag": "music",  // Unique identifier
    "patterns": ["play music", "song recommendation", "favorite music"],
    "responses": [
        "I love all kinds of music! 🎵 What's your favorite genre?",
        "Music makes everything better! 🎶 Tell me about your playlist!",
        "I wish I could sing! 🎤 What songs do you enjoy?"
    ]
}
```

### Customizing the Look & Feel

**Colors**: Search for CSS custom properties at the top of the `<style>` section:
```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #0078d7;    /* Change main theme color */
    --secondary-color: #00c6fb;  /* Change gradient accent */
    --background: #e0eafc;       /* Change page background */
}
```

**Animations**: Modify transition timings and effects in the CSS animations section.
